Intro to Dart (Prerequisite before using Flutter)
----------------------------------------------------
- Dart is an Open source programming language developed by google.
- It has similarities with Javascript/Java
- It's used for building web, mobile and desktop apps
- It can also help to create UI, Servers and more
- 2 Compilation Processes : JIT (just in time) and AOT (Ahead of time)
- The main difference between the two is that AOT compiles code at build time while JIT does it during runtime(coding the program)
- To write Dart we require SDK (Software Development Kit)
- Software Development Kit is nothing but tools that are required to code and run the dart in our machine and deploy it securily as well

- We can use DartPad or Dart SDK to run code (Dart SDK preferred)
